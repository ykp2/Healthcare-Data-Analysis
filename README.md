Context:The goal of this analysis is to showcase the effectiveness of the marketplace provided by the product, iQueue. We have the data for the 'Exchange' transactions that happened via iQueue for a new customer. 'iQueue' is a software product used to free up capacity in operating rooms and create a much more transparent and surgeon-centric process for measuring Operating Room (OR) utilization in healthcare.

The metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness are:

1) Total time exchanged via the marketplace
2) Percentage of release time utilized
3) Percentage of requests fulfilled
4) Processing time of requests, releases and transfers
